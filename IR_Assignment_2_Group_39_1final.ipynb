            " - Text: This gum is delicious and since my first pack I have been hooked.  I love the Mint Chocolate Chip after meals, and the Key Lime Pie is delectable at all other times.<br /><br />At $15/10 pack on Amazon, it's not really a deal, though, considering this is only a $1 a pack at target or mcwallymart.  Once the price of a 10-pack drops to about $10 or $11 I might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness, but a 50% premium is not really worth it. | Sentiment: Positive\n",
            " - Text: Tea has a great flavor - almost what I'd call 'spearmint' flavor which is great with honey or sugar with or without cream. I drink it hot and if it does cool, it's still good.  It does help me relax and go to sleep when I've had a long day.  My grandchildren love the flavor and we often share a pot of tea as it is perfectly safe for them.  Celestial Seasoning Teas are great teas always but Sleepytime is one of their classics! I'd recommend this tea to anyone, as out of all of Celestial Seasonings teas, this is probably ranks as close to number one on my list of favorites.  And I do have a lot of their tea in my pantry -- my son swears I must own stock in it, LOL.  If you like tea, try it, I really think you'll be glad you did as I feel Sleepytime truly is one of their best teas. :) | Sentiment: Positive\n",

I was pleased that the candy had not gotten soft or sticky in transit, as sometimes an order for the 34 ounce bag will do.

In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson | Sentiment: Positive\n",

The fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus, (for us heat lovers) and a curse(for the wussies).<br />I use this stuff all the time.  Sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato, sprinkle it over some Mexican sour cream for a dip.  Sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad.  The uses are near endless.<br /><br />Also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray, a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement.<br />Be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff, if you get a smal puff of it into your nose, you will most definately know about it.  ;-P | Sentiment: Positive\n",

I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.

I often find it hard to find flavored K-Cups that aren't either 1) so strong you lose the flavor or 2) so light you'd be better off drinking water. However, I have to admit I have found a new favorite in the Hawaiian Hazelnut! | Sentiment: Positive\n",

            " - Text: I have now owned this product for over a year and it is still going strong. I mainly use it for voice overs for YouTube videos, Skype calls, and recording music. It all works great.<br /><br />When I first received it in the mail, I simply opened it, plugged it in, and it worked. As simple as that. There were no drivers, no installation, and no updates. I just plugged my XLR condenser microphone into the Icicle and the Icicle to the USB on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a USB mic.<br /><br />This product was WAY lighter than I expected and feels rather cheap. However, that is not really an issue because the product works great. And the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal.<br /><br />The knob is also useful, as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, as it is plug and play. Very simple, and it just works. | Sentiment: Positive\n",

It is very sweet, however - I prefer to mix it with something such as Cheerios when eating it for breakfast since the sugar can be overpowering as you get close to the bottom of the bowl.<br /><br />Good value if you can get it on an Amazon price dip and/or when they run a promo. | Sentiment: Positive\n",

It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.<br /><br />I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.<br />I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.<br /><br />I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece. I will stick with the latter shape in the future. | Sentiment: Negative\n",

            " - Text: This tea is definitely worth trying as you may find that it's your favorite.  I've tried Irish Breakfast from most online Tea Shops to try to find one that is superior.<br /><br />Taylor's has some fine teas, but I didn't find this variety superior enough to keep buying it.

            " - Text: I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did. | Sentiment: Negative\n",

He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.

I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice. | Sentiment: Negative\n",

You have to follow the true process, starting with sweated shallots, then parching the rice, then deglazing with white wine, and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often. If you follow this procedure (and/or find a good recipe), you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest, most mouth-meltingly tender rice you've ever had.

However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.  Comparing the price per each on Amazon vs. a local store finds it much cheaper here on Amazon.  I recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too. | Sentiment: Positive\n",

For the price, I got 1 lbs. 4 oz. of biscotti (I weighed it on my kitchen scale) cut into 10 big pieces.  Add the shipping and handling, and that comes out to a little more than $2 per piece.  This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten \"as is\" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.

A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M\">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com.

This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to \"make the switch\" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price. | Sentiment: Negative\n",

You have to follow the true process, starting with sweated shallots, then parching the rice, then deglazing with white wine, and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often. If you follow this procedure (and/or find a good recipe), you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest, most mouth-meltingly tender rice you've ever had. Why pay for it in a restaurant when it's so easy to make at home? | Sentiment: 1\n",

Grade B is the healthy maple syrup, the REAL STUFF, and at first tastes a little darker than this and others you've had (which are almost surely the cheaper and more processed Grade A) but is far better for you and much healthier. If they can maintain this quality but offer a Grade B, we simply will NEVER get anther syrup brand again.

I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually \"grape must\" and a condiment quality.

However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.  Comparing the price per each on Amazon vs. a local store finds it much cheaper here on Amazon.

This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google \"Other Names for MSG\" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as \"spices\" or \"natural flavors.\"  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label. At least this manufacturer had the decency to list what was in the flavor base. | Sentiment: -1\n",

This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten \"as is\" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.

The fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus, (for us heat lovers) and a curse(for the wussies).<br />I use this stuff all the time.  Sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato, sprinkle it over some Mexican sour cream for a dip.  Sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad.  The uses are near endless.<br /><br />Also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray, a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement.<br />Be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff, if you get a smal puff of it into your nose, you will most definately know about it.  ;-P | Sentiment: 1\n",

I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!!

I just plugged my XLR condenser microphone into the Icicle and the Icicle to the USB on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a USB mic.<br /><br />This product was WAY lighter than I expected and feels rather cheap. However, that is not really an issue because the product works great. And the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal.<br /><br />The knob is also useful, as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, as it is plug and play.

Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.

            " - Text: When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to \"make the switch\" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price. | Sentiment: -1\n",

I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I didn't like this coffee at all; in fact, it was the first of the four samples I've tried so far that I did not like.  To me, it tasted like over-brewed coffee--i.e., like coffee that has been sitting in the pot for several hours.  It wasn't bitter, exactly, but it just did not have a particularly appealing flavor.

It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.<br /><br />I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.<br />I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.<br /><br />I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece.

A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M\">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com.

Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.

There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google \"Other Names for MSG\" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as \"spices\" or \"natural flavors.\"  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label.

The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).

A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M\">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com.

Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that, I'm just not part of it.<br /><br />Nice little carbonated juice, but still not really worth the effort/money for me. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to \"make the switch\" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: Together with many customers, I was frustrated when Tassimo and Starbucks ended their relationship. My coffee was Verona.<br />Since that time, I have tried various alternatives (Gevalia Espresso, Tassimo Carte Noir, Tassimo Nabob & Kenco Med Roast) but with limited and varying degrees of success.<br />After reading a previous review, I sent off for a supply to test it - I love it!!!!<br /><br />I was on the point of giving my Tassimo machine away - no more.<br /><br />A great start to the New Year. | Sentiment: 1\n",
            " - Text: I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: I had hoped this tea would taste better but it just tastes to me like I steeped weeds from the backyard. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again. | Sentiment: -1\n",
            " - Text: Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink. | Sentiment: 1\n",
            " - Text: How did peanut shells get into the mix? Thank goodness I don't have an allergy, esp. since they looked like the ovaries of the flower at first. Some of them were even stained red so they looked like petals. There should at least be a warning that there could be peanut and other allergens in the product. This is just a class action waiting to happen. | Sentiment: -1\n"
